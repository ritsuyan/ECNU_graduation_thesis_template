With the rapid progress of industrial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things and cloud computing,
In a new way, the car is shifting from traditional closed systems to smart cities, intelligent transportation, intelligent communication, and intelligent driving. Therefore, modern intelligent connected cars will face unprecedented security threats and attacks. Hackers or attackers can access and control vehicles illegally through external interfaces such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and honeycomb. Automotive network security issues are becoming more prominent than ever. More and more international security standards have also shown that automobile network security has been improved to the same or more important position as functional security. This article mainly has the following three contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Firstly, the architecture of intelligent networked vehicles is studied, and the security threats it faces are analyzed, and the attack sources and attack paths are analyzed.
    \item Not only the traditional attack tree is used to model the threat of intelligent networked automobile system, but also an improved attack tree threat modeling scheme based on Microsoft STRIDE (called SATT) is proposed.;
    \item The simulation and modeling experiments were performed through the well -known security software ISOGRAPH Attacktree +. Study the remote attack method of intelligent connected cars, conduct vulnerability mining and penetration tests for cars, attack the vehicle system through various methods such as Bluetooth hijacking signals, data tampering bags and car union APP cracking, and successfully obtain target vehicle sensitive information and real -time location.  And achieve remote invasion and fully control
  \end{itemize}
  It aims to provide more comprehensive security risk assessment for more risk assessment and relieving personnel through research on the threat of intelligent connected cars.
  Based on the threat analysis of traditional attack trees, there are shortcomings with many subjective factors and low accuracy. This article proposes a new SATT threat modeling solution. With the help of Microsoft's Stride threat model, we identify threats corresponding to assets and build a more comprehensive attack tree. For each threat attack sequence of the attack tree, the attack probability is based on FAHP. In addition, it compares it with traditional methods. The results show that the method plays a certain role in the analysis of security threats. Finally, for cars, hackers can use multiple methods to attack, such as using Bluetooth hijacking signals, data tampering bags, and reverse compilation of cracked car connected APP. These attacks can cause cars to be remotely controlled, which threatens the safety of intelligent connected cars and drivers.
